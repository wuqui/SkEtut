# Compiling corpora
## Data format {.smaller}

<https://www.sketchengine.eu/guide/create-corpus-from-files/>

texts **without annotations**: most common

- structure: (ideally) use **1 document per file**
- file formats: **plain text**
  - `.txt`
  - `.csv`
  - …

**annotated texts**: 

- `.xml`: powerful, but more involved

## Raw data {.smaller}
### Text files

![](att/moby-dick-raw.png){height=400}

Melville: *Moby Dick* – available as part of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)

---

### Tabular data

1. extract the column containing the text body from your spreadsheet (e.g. in new sheet)
2. export this column to `.csv`
3. you can then import this column in SkE just like a `.txt`

Note, however, that (meta)data in other columns will be lost[^xml].

[^xml]: To preserve these data, you would have to convert your tabular data (`.xlsx` or `.csv`) into `xml` format before importing.


## Uploading files

## Adding and editing metadata

![Adding and editing metadata](att/edit-metadata.png){#fig-adding-metadata}

## Processed data {.smaller}

After compiling: `vert` ('vertical') format – word per line (WPL)[^1] 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](att/moby-dick-vert-meta.png){height=300}
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](att/moby-dick-vert.png){height=350}
:::
::::

[^1]: More precisely: one *token* per line, including puctuation: e.g. `it`, '\'s', `,`.

## Available corpora {.smaller}

Browse full list of (English) corpora [here](https://app.sketchengine.eu/#corpus?tab=advanced&cat=all&sketches=0&lang=en&lang2=&query=&showOld=0).

Among others, …

- [English Historical Book Collection (EEBO, ECCO, Evans)](https://app.sketchengine.eu/#dashboard?corpname=preloaded%2Fearly_english&corp_info=1): '**historical** corpus collection of English books published in the UK and the USA between 1473 and 1820'
- [Gutenberg Project](https://app.sketchengine.eu/#dashboard?corpname=preloaded%2Fgutenberg20_en&corp_info=1): large **book** corpus; also available for other languages
- [British National Corpus (BNC)](https://app.sketchengine.eu/#dashboard?corpname=preloaded%2Fbnc2_tt21&corp_info=1): 'A balanced English corpus of samples of a written and spoken language of **British English** from the later part of the 20th century (1969–1994)'
- [English Web 2020 (enTenTen20)](https://www.sketchengine.eu/ententen-english-corpus/): big **web** corpus, including metadata about topics, genres, and web domains (e.g. `.com` vs `.co.uk`)
- [Timestamped JSI web corpus 2014-2021 English](https://app.sketchengine.eu/#dashboard?corpname=preloaded%2Feng_jsi_newsfeed_virt&corp_info=1): huge **diachronic web** corpus, annotated for topic, sentiment and more


## Subcorpora {.smaller}

You can create subcorpora for pre-loaded and self-compiled corpora based on

- all available **metadata** categories (e.g. timestamps, topics, filenames)
- **concordance** searches

![](att/creating-subcorpora.png)

## Queries {.smaller}

You run queries from the `Concordance` view.

There are two options:

- *basic* searches: basic
- *advanced* searches: more involved and powerful (e.g. searching for constructions based on lemmatized forms or word classes)

![](att/concordance-query-types.png)

---

### Basic queries

![](att/simple-search.png)

---

### Advanced (CQL) queries 

![](att/query-advanced-cql.png)

Helpful: [manual](https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/corpus-querying/) and `CQL builder`.

---

![](att/cql-builder.png)

---

Extracting parts of your query matches using `within`:

![](att/queries-cql-within.png)

---

### Filtering by metadata

Options:

- query metadata within **CQL syntax** (e.g. `[word="bank"] within <doc topic="recreation" />`)
- perform 'text type'[^texttype] filtering using the **dropdown menus**, which is also available for simple queries (see above).

[^texttype]: 'Text types' in SkE are not text types in the linguistic sense, but in the technical sense: documents have different text types if they differ regarding any metadata category. For example, two 'types' could be texts tagged for `<doc year="1900">` vs `<doc year="2000">`.

## Concordance view

![](att/concordance-view.png)

## Collocations {.smaller}

![](att/collocations-commit.png)

Additional measures (e.g. log likelihood) and other options are available in the advanced settings.

## Word sketches

### Word sketch difference: between two words/phrases

### Visualizations

![](att/word-sketch-visual-life.png)

## Annotating data {.smaller}

**for metadata**: see @fig-adding-metadata above

**for concordance lines**:

![](att/annotating-concordance-lines.png)

## Exporting data {.smaller}

Almost everything can be exported:

- your entire annotated **corpora**
- results from **queries/concordances**
- results from **collocations**
- results from **word sketches**

I recommend exporting data in `.xlsx` format, since this seems to be best supported by SkE.[^csv]

[^csv]: When exporting to `csv`, be careful with decimal/thousands separator: when using the `Text to columns` option in Excel, use `.` as decimal and `,` as thousands separator (e.g. one thousand point five: `1,000.5`).

# Use cases
## Compiling a corpus: dead authors' minds {.smaller}

See Section *Compiling corpora* above.

**Sharing corpora**: the toy corpus of Gutenberg books that I created for this tutorial is named `qw-gutenberg ` and it should be accessible by all LMUlers.

![](att/corpus-sharing.png)

## Studying syntactic constructions: *the N BE that* {.smaller}

Select pre-loaded corpus: [Gutenberg English 2020](https://app.sketchengine.eu/#concordance?corpname=preloaded%2Fgutenberg20_en&corp_info=1)

![](att/corp-gutenberg-preloaded.png)

Query inspired by: Schmid, Hans-Jörg, and Annette Mantlik. 2015. 'Entrenchment in Historical Corpora? Reconstructing Dead Authors' Minds from Their Usage Profiles'. *Anglia* 133 (4): 583—623.
